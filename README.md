# The Truth Machine Initiative

Researchers who fake data commit academic fraud, damaging the credibility of science. In one case, psychology researcher Diederik Stapel faked data for years without anyone knowing, eventually leading to fifty-eight retracted papers and widespread public skepticism of psychological research.

The Truth Machine Initiative ensures research honesty through custom devices designed to record data truthfully and certify its authenticity. Every sensor reading is cryptographically sealed the moment it's captured, creating an unalterable record that prevents tampering of research data before and after publication. This system gives researchers, funders, and the public confidence that published results reflect genuine observations rather than fabricated data.

The Truth Machine Initiative is commissioned by Causality Network, a research integrity and decentralized science project committed to securing truth in academia. The hardware and firmware are designed by Veracity Labs, a company specializing in technological solutions for verifiable truth.

## The Honest Bioreactor

The Honest Bioreactor is an open-source fork of the Pioreactor project that introduces cryptographic verification to bioreactor experiments. Built on a foundation of tamper-proof hardware, it creates verifiable records of all bioreactor conditions and measurements. The system uses a Zymbit secure compute module for data processing, with all sensors directly connected to cryptographic processors to ensure fully authenticated communication.

The project can be found in the `honest-pioreactor` repository and runs on a customized operating system, `honest-debian`, designed specifically for verified data collection.
